                    “My fate cries out<br>And makes each petty arture in [his] body<br>As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve”

                    The Ghost is controlling Hamlet to the fullest extent as Hamlet’s life seems to revolve around fulfilling the Ghost’s deeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Fate cries out,” conveys how Hamlet establishes the realization that his future lies in the hands of the Ghost. This conveys how the Ghost has dictated all aspects of his life.                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost is fully aware about this and knows that it may deteriorate Hamlet’s well-being. However, the Ghost only cares about Hamlet seeking revenge. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This quote also implies that Hamlet thinks his destiny will be set in stone once he hears what the Ghost of his father has to say.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hamlet feels like he is bound to fulfill the Ghost’s desire and that his whole life and mind is occupied to seek revenge. The Ghost is fully aware of this and is fully relying on his son to carry out the revenge. The Ghost is putting his son’s health and life in harm for his own desires. At this point, Hamlet has no free will and is solely obeying his father.

            <p>
                <i>
                    “If thou didst ever thy dear father love—...<br>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.”
                </i>
                <br>The Ghost in Lines 29, 31

                    This piece of interaction between the Ghost and Hamlet resulted in a realization of his purpose. Prior to this event, Hamlet was experiencing a perpetual state of confusion due to the loss of his father. It was at this moment where he established what his true purpose is; avenging his father’s death. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hamlet is given the message from the Ghost to go his way to seek revenge, which is one of the main themes of Hamlet. This statement by the Ghost evokes the fire within Hamlet, creating a strong motive to seek revenge for himself and the Ghost. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this instance, a rudimentary idea is established as this marks the beginning of Hamlet’s journey to avenge his father. Overcome with self-doubt, Hamlet starts his journey to avenge his late father despite not fully deducing the good and the bad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost tells Hamlet to seek revenge for both of them. From this, it can be deduced that the Ghost has motives that align with the motives of Hamlet. The Ghost is exploiting Hamlet to achieve both of their goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost is well aware of that fact that Hamlet is overcome with grief and uses this to his advantage, manipulating Hamlet’s emotions and abusing the devotion he has towards his father to make him do his dirty work, rather than let his son know he loved him or let him go about his life and move on he demands Hamlet avenge him no matter what the cost is to himself or the others around him.

            <p>
                <i>
                    “The spirit that I have seen.<br>May be the devil, and the devil hath power<br>T' assume a pleasing shape.”
                </i>
                <br>Hamlet in Lines 627 - 629
            </p>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hamlet is currently pondering if King Claudius killed his father or is innocent while scrutinizing the King's face. If he turns out to be innocent, the Ghost of his father would be the devil.                 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hamlet is aware that the devil can fool people by appearing as someone they adore and miss much, just as Hamlet does his father.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point in the play, Hamlet’s contemplation underlies his realization of what the devil does. Hamlet’s enhanced perspicacity has caused him to be pragmatic. Hamlet questions whether or not the Ghost of King Hamlet is the devil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost’s true intentions are to use Hamlet to fulfill his deeds to the extent of manipulating Hamlet’s emotions and abusing his well-being. Hamlet feeds on this possibility which causes him to ponder on who is the devil. At first, Hamlet would always be quick to believe the Ghost because of his strong emotional attachment to his Father.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function of the Ghost remains unchanged as the Ghost’s motive stays the same. The Ghost wants his motive to linger within his son to achieve his goal. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    “The spirit that I have seen / May be the devil,” conveys that complexities have been established in the relationship between Hamlet and the Ghost. Hamlet feigns madness since the start of his journey. He questions the existence of the Ghost and whether or not it is the devil. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost is not concerned with Hamlet’s well-being in the slightest, despite his young age. The Ghost is solely concerned about Hamlet killing Claudius. Hamlet feels constrained to carry out his duty to seek revenge. This is because he believed and did whatever the Ghost told him to. The notion of free will is hinted at when Hamlets starts to question the Ghost and contemplate whether or not he is the devil.

                Hamlet in his gut felt that what he saw was too good to be true and that trouble was afoot but he set those feelings aside more than once because he was blind to what was going on (Illusion vs. Reality) he wants to see a loving father who has come back to him, oblivious to the fact that his father has controlled him into doing his bidding and that he is in fact not what he appears to be but it is his need for this to be true and the strong bond he shared with his father that compels him to follow through even if it doesn’t seem rational.

                    The curse (Abel and Cain) has rubbed onto both Claudius and the King (Free Will vs. Predetermination) however the story is different from that of the Christian tale as the victim of this instance comes back and does what can to get revenge on the ‘evil’ brother.

                <li>
                    All the problems in the play began not when Hamlet talked to the Ghost but of the relationship between Claudius and the King, and had they not been hellbent on power and later revenge (the king) the dominos would not have toppled and deaths could have been prevented as well as sanity could have been held on to.

                <li>
                    Inherited Sins vs. Sins Committed: it is Claudius who murdered the king and this action led to the king coming back as a spirit thirsty for revenge, this sin act involved two people but the children, and others of the kingdom paid for their sins, and Hamlet payed by committing sins of his own led by the invisible hand of his father. Hamlet is not at fault for everything that happened, Claudius and The King committed sin and this sin is carried on the shoulders of Hamlet and later Laertes and Ophelia.

                Hamlet’s own mother is questioning his sanity and the Ghost appears only to Hamlet and not to help him but only to make certain that he follows through with his mission. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be assumed that only Hamlet can see the Ghost but the Ghost was visible to more than just Hamlet in the beginning raising the idea that the Ghost can choose who he wants to be visible to and rather than appear to the mother and help Hamlet he does not do so because it would not serve his purpose. Revenge is all that is important to him, nothing not even his son’s well being matters, this showing that revenge can blind and corrupt a person, not much is known about the king before he died but it can be inferred now that the humiliating death he endured at the hands of his brother shattered him and so he came back as a vengeful spirit (a common plot now for many horror stories) and seeks out death.

                    “That skull had a tongue in it and could sing<br>once. How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it<br>t’were Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!”

            <p>
                According to the biblical theology that consisted of Cain and Abel, Cain killed Abel with the jawbone of an ass (donkey). Hamlet imagines Cain's skull being flung, or jowled (jowl also means jawbone), to the ground by a "ass" gravedigger. Hamlet then comments that Cain may be regarded as the first politician since, when God inquired about his brother's whereabouts, he avoided providing a direct response - he "circumvented God."
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote by Hamlet is in reference towards the Ghost being murdered by King Claudius, which narrates the same trajectory towards the theme of Inherited Sins vs Sins Committed by an Individual.
