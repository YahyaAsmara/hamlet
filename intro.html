        <h2>What is Hamlet</h2>
        <p>
            Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare in the early 17th century, is one of the most enduring pieces of literature in the Western canon. Its history is very complex. At its heart, it is a revenge play. Riverside Shakespeare notes that plays in which revenge is the focus of the plot became fashionable around 1599. Most Shakespeare scholars accept that Hamlet was written between 1599 and 1601. As with most of Shakespeare’s plays, Hamlet is based on earlier stories and texts. Riverside Shakespeare mentions a play also titled Hamlet by Kyd possibly written in the mid to late 16th century. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Shakespeare wrote Hamlet during a historical time in which western society was on the brink of the first major scientific revolution of human history. This revolution, beginning near the late 16th century, gradually but completely changed western society's understanding of nature and science over the next two centuries. Shakespeare would likely have been aware of advancements in scientific thought. Especially relevant to our subject is the publication of Copernicus' On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543, about twenty-one years before Shakespeare's birth. The idea that the Sun was the center of the universe, although it had been posed before by Greek philosophers, was a hugely significant departure in Shakespeare's time from the prevalent idea that the Earth was at the universe's center.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a man like Shakespeare who was so curious about human life and the context in which we all exist, this time must have been extremely stimulating. Shakespeare was eminently engaged with life and living, and he must have been aware of new advances in science and philosophy.

        <h2>Context of the Elizabethan Worldview</h2>
        <p>
            The ghost appeared at the same time the night before, and we see that Barnardo marks the time by referencing the path of the star in the sky. He also refers to the path of the star using the personal pronoun "his" in line 44.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                “When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br>Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven<br>Where now it burns…”
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Elizabethan concept of the universe and humans' place in it comes from the philosophies and writings of the ancient Greeks. Scholars from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century studied Greek philosophy avidly. They were aware of the Ptolemaic world view which held that the Earth was the center of the universe and the celestial bodies orbited the earth, while the fixed stars, comprising the constellations, were motionless. This was the predominant concept of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations from the Sumerians to the Babylonians.
