                    The armor is representative of the violence the king participated in regards to the many wars that were won under his lead and the blood that was shed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The crown of the king, respected by others and the reason for the king's death, as greed and lust for power compels people to commit unspeakable actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “He smote…” indicating the king was not one to repulse from violence but instead was a willing and most eager participant in the course of action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point in the play the ghost looks as though he is just a troubled spirit contradicting the violence that his dress loudly represents trying to show that he just needs help, is not a demon as they may think, just troubled, lost, and in a purgatory of sorts.
                </li>

                This is when the Ghost is first introduced, Horatio and Marcellus want the ghost to speak to them but it will not. It is very intentional and meaningful that in this moment the ghost does not speak, in this moment it seems as though the King's ghost is but a spirit wanting to move on but something is trapping it on the earthly plane.
            </p>
            <p>
                They try to attack the ghost with a sword thinking that a show of force will provoke it and make it talk but it simply disappears after this action. This could mean that it abhors violence which would make sense as it is violence that ended his life, the ghost could be afraid of them but this wouldn’t make much sense as it is a spirit and cannot be hurt by physical objects, the other reason and one that proved to be true is it wanted to put on a guise, one of a sad soul, one that others would feel guilty for, doing this so his son would hear of him and then revealing his true intentions but only to him so as the ghost would not be judged by those in the right mind. <b>(Illusion vs. Reality)</b>
