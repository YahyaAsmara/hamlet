            <p>
                <i>
                    “If thou didst ever thy dear father love—...Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.”
                </i>

                    This piece of interaction between the Ghost and Hamlet resulted in a realization of his purpose. Prior to this event, Hamlet was experiencing a perpetual state of confusion due to the loss of his father. It was at this moment where he established what his true purpose is; avenging his father’s death. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hamlet is given the message from the Ghost to go his way to seek revenge, which is one of the main themes of Hamlet. This statement by the Ghost evokes the fire within Hamlet, creating a strong motive to seek revenge for himself and the Ghost. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this instance, a rudimentary idea is established as this marks the beginning of Hamlet’s journey to avenge his father. Overcome with self-doubt, Hamlet starts his journey to avenge his late father despite not fully deducing the good and the bad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ghost tells Hamlet to seek revenge for both of them. From this, it can be deduced that the ghost has motives that align with the motives of Hamlet. The ghost is exploiting Hamlet to achieve both of their goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ghost is well aware of that fact that Hamlet is overcome with grief and uses this to his advantage, manipulating Hamlet’s emotions and abusing the devotion he has towards his father to make him do his dirty work, rather than let his son know he loved him or let him go about his life and move on he demands Hamlet avenge him no matter what the cost is to himself or the others around him. (Fathers and Sons)

            <h3>Act 3 Scene 2</h3>
            <p>
                <i>
                    “If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech,<br>It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,<br>And my imaginations are as foul…”
                </i>

                Hamlet in his gut felt that what he saw was too good to be true and that trouble was afoot but he set those feelings aside more than once because he was blind to what was going on (Illusion vs. Reality) he wants to see a loving father who has come back to him, oblivious to the fact that his father has controlled him into doing his bidding and that he is in fact not what he appears to be but it is his need for this to be true and the strong bond he shared with his father that compels him to follow through even if it doesn’t seem rational.

            <h3>Act 3 Scene 3</h3>
            <p>
                <i>
                    “Oh, my offence is rank. It smells to heaven. / It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.” 
                </i>
            </p>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The curse (Abel and Cain) has rubbed onto both Claudius and the King (Free Will vs. Predetermination) however the story is different from that of the Christian tale as the victim of this instance comes back and does what can to get revenge on the ‘evil’ brother. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the problems in the play began not when Hamlet talked to the ghost but of the relationship between Claudius and the King, and had they not been hellbent on power and later revenge (the king) the dominos would not have toppled and deaths could have been prevented as well as sanity could have been held on to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inherited Sins vs. Sins Committed: it is Claudius who murdered the king and this action led to the king coming back as a spirit thirsty for revenge, this sin act involved two people but the children, and others of the kingdom paid for their sins, and Hamlet payed by committing sins of his own led by the invisible hand of his father. Hamlet is not at fault for everything that happened, Claudius and The King committed sin and this sin is carried on the shoulders of Hamlet and later Laertes and Ophelia.

            <h3>Act 3 Scene 4</h3>
            <p>
                <i>
                    “Do not forget.<br>This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.”
                </i>
            </p>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <p>
                Hamlet’s own mother is questioning his sanity and the ghost appears only to Hamlet and not to help him but only to make certain that he follows through with his mission. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be assumed that only Hamlet can see the ghost but the ghost was visible to more than just Hamlet in the beginning raising the idea that the ghost can choose who he wants to be visible to and rather than appear to the mother and help Hamlet he does not do so because it would not serve his purpose. Revenge is all that is important to him, nothing not even his son’s well being matters, this showing that revenge can blind and corrupt a person, not much is known about the king before he died but it can be inferred now that the humiliating death he endured at the hands of his brother shattered him and so he came back as a vengeful spirit (a common plot now for many horror stories) and seeks out death.
