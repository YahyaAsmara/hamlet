                The context of the Elizabethan worldview is exceptionally prominent in Hamlet, especially in the indirect characterization for the Ghost. The Ghost is a character that exists between the boundaries of life and death, in the form of a phantom that can be seen by Hamlet and his associates. This way of existing is in accordance with the belief of Heaven and Hell, which is predominantly a component regarding religious theology.

                The Ghost effectively gained control of Hamlet to make Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet is constrained to his duty to seek revenge and has very limited free will. This slowly worsens Hamlet’s mental well-being. The Ghost is fully aware of this but continues to baffle Hamlet and increase his desire for vengeance to the extent of making revenge his obsession.

        <p class="caption">This image echoes how Hamlet was under the influence of the Ghost to a severe extent. Hamlet feeling deeply constrained to his duty to avenge his father deteriorated his mental wellness and his quality of life. Hamlet had very limited free will and was almost as if he was the Ghost’s puppet. This image depicts the Ghost and the individual in a helpless and mentally trapped state of mind. This all is a result of the Ghost’s actions.</p>

                The Ghost puts on a facade through the whole play using the appearance of the King to his advantage knowing the power this image has, playing the tortured soul in front of Horatio and Marcellus knowing their respect for the King will lead to them speaking to Hamlet whose grief and desire for this story to be true has him meeting the Ghost. The Ghost looks like Hamlet’s father and he manipulates Hamlet’s emotions into getting Hamlet to do his murderous deeds for him, the truth that Hamlet refuses to see is that this is not his father and even if it was he is not the person he used to be and will only bring death to Hamlet and those around him. The Ghost is in fact a devil but the shape and appearance of the King is one that demands respect from others and a perfect curtain to shade away the interior motives of revenge.

                One of the key themes is revenge. Fortinbras, Laertes, and Hamlet were seeking to get revenge for their fathers' deaths. Revenge sets up unfavourable feelings and thoughts, which cause someone to act irrationally. The Ghost's motive throughout the play has consistently been for his son to exact revenge on him. On his quest to get revenge on his father, Hamlet encounters irrationality, self-doubt, a decline in wellbeing, and solitude. The motivation behind Hamlet's actions and line of thought is revenge, which is a motivation that is simple to justify. He experiences an internal battle of self-doubt, confusion, a mixture of strong emotions, and indecisiveness. His desire for vengeance is stoked by the spirit, which causes him to focus on getting even.

        <img src="img/10.jpg" alt="Revenge Crown">
        <p class="caption">Revenge succumbs an individual and can become an obsession. The ghost constantly triggers Hamlet’s vengeance to make revenge his obsession. Deteriorated mental health becomes a result of this and it seems like Hamlet is dedicating his entire life to carry out the revenge. This is evident to Hamlet as he understands that his fate is in the hands of the ghost. This image depicts how Hamlet’s obsession with revenge has consumed him. He is in a helpless state of mind and the heart in the individual’s hands depicts how Hamlet is dedicating his life to seek revenge and how his fate is in the Ghost’s hands.</p>

            <h2 id="sins" style="margin-top: 10px;">Inherited Sins vs Sins Committed by an Individual</h2>

                Among the paradoxes and contrasts prevalent in Hamlet, the Ghost is most specifically in foil with King Claudius; the old king vs the current King of Denmark. The theme, Inherited Sins vs Sins Committed by an Individual is a representation of the brotherhood between them, and their relationship similar to Abel and Cain. With this biblical allegory in mind, the symbolism of the two brothers is clear, where one murdered the other with greed and jealousy, thus prompting the “first sin,” and how it’s correlated with the theme of inherited sins.
            </p>
            <p>
                In relation to Hamlet, it is evident that the “first sin” is a catalyst that prompted the rest of the play to even exist in the first place, such that the actions fo the Ghost is a point of change within the situation of Denmark. Hamlet’s dynamism sparks change within himself and the people around him, thus committing sins as a result.

                Throughout the play, there are several instances where the role of a father and the role of a son is characterized. The main father and son depicted throughout, is most prominently the Ghost as the father, and Hamlet as the son. These two characters are the primary indications of the theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yorick is a tertiary character that functions as a tool for Hamlet’s personal dynamism, suggesting that the father-son relationship between the Ghost and Hamlet is not all that it seems, prompting Yorick's skull to be an object and symbol for the complex theme that appears to be simple.

        <p class="caption">The characterization of the role of a father and the role of a son throughout the play consists of the Ghost being the father and Hamlet as the son. Yorick is a character that purports that this relationship between these two characters is not what it seems. The Ghost is using Hamlet as a tool for his motives. Hamlet is indoctrinated by the ghost in a way since in the early stages of the play, the driving force of Hamlet’s actions was the Ghost. Hamlet acted on behalf of the Ghost due to his strong relationship with his father.</p>
