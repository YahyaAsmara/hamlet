            "...Alas, poor<br>Yorick! I knew him, Horatio-a fellow of infinite<br>jest, of many excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his<br>back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in<br>my imagination it is!"
          </i>

        <p>Hamlet in Act 1 Scene 1 Lines 190 - 194</p>
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        <p>
          The importance of Yorick is his role as a deceased jester and the underlying meaning that all returns to dust, is the suggestion that Yorick was more of a father than the Ghost. This interpretation of the relationship between Yorick and Hamlet is brief, but the idea has been established through Hamlet’s perceived agony over discovering the death of Yorick. While Yorick may seem to be a character that shouldn’t impact the plot in any way, the theme of his demise is creatively adjusted towards the tragedy, and <i>the very essence</i> of the play.
        </p>
        <p>
          The juxtaposition between Yorick's infinite jest, of most exquisite fancy (as "a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy") and his dismal remains focuses on the theme of worldly vanity: death is certain, hence the things of this life are insignificant. Memento Mori is the theme that arose from this notion, the very tragedy and death of Hamlet and the characters pertaining. Yorick is a symbol of death, and his skull, a symbol of his character towards Hamlet; a father deceased with skeletal remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paradoxes outlined as a result of this derived theme then focuses on the characters themselves, and as mentioned previously, the contrast between the Ghost and King Claudius, and the contrast between the Ghost as a father figure and Yorick as a father figure. While it is not certain that Yorick was a better father figure, regardless of this notion, the death of Yorick and the death the Ghost is what remains to be the same between both of them.
