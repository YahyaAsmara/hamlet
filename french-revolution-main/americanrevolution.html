        <h2>Preliminary Stage</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                <b>Economically weak-government deficits necessitate taxation:</b> Great Britain was in severe need of finances, as the national debt was extraordinarily high and the treasury had been depleted as a result of the war with France. As a result, King George III imposed a number of levies on colonists without their approval, including the Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Symbolic actionsâ€”there is a rallying point against the old regime:</b> colonists were outraged by British levies and began to protest. The Sons of Liberty were a significant protest group against the Stamp Act of 1765. They set fire to effigies that resembled tax collectors. Tax collectors were frequently pelted with hot tar and feathers by colonists.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>There is class animosity, and there is a struggle between the old regime and the new forces:</b> Paul Revere's engraving depicts a firsthand experience of the Boston Massacre. Five colonists were killed by British soldiers in this massacre, which occurred in 1770. To maintain order and put down rebellions against the Townshend Acts, British troops were stationed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

        <h2>First Stage: Rule of the Moderates</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                <b>Protests against the government are on the rise, and they're having a big impact:</b> When the Tea Act was passed in 1773, colonists united in a major protest: The Boston Tea Party is a historic event in the United States. Hundreds of colonists masquerading as Native Americans poured more than 300 cartons of tea and other taxed commodities into Boston Harbor. As Great Britain struggled to keep the colonists under control, this brave and spontaneous insurrection pushed the country closer to independence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>There is a revolutionary underground (radicals):</b> After the Intolerable Acts were passed in 1774, the First Continental Congress assembled to discuss how to proceed in the war for independence. The Continental Army was founded during the Second Continental Congress in 1775, with George Washington as its commander. The Continental Army's mission was to organize military actions in the revolution against Britain.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
               After the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the war formally began.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Radicals seize power (real revolution):</b> With the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the colonists finally gained control. It was a statement outlining their demands for rights as well as a list of grievances against King George III. The signing of the proclamation signaled the start of a war to persuade Britain to recognise the colonies as sovereign nations.
            </p>
            <p>
                George Washington, the commander in chief of the Continental Army, was picked by the Congress to lead the council. He was well-liked by the colonists, and they all followed his directions. He commanded his troops and led them through numerous difficult battles, including Valley Forge and the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.

        <h2>Third Stage: Recovery Stage</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
               The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, formally ended the war by restoring pleasure, religion, and the status quo. Things in the colonies have reverted to their previous state. Prior to the taxes, the colonies functioned as a free country but still officially under British sovereignty (King George III didn't interfere with them until he needed money). The colonies were now formally recognised as a country in their own right.
            </p>
            <p>
                People exchange "doing" freedom for "not doing" freedom: The colonists began to struggle for greater freedoms now that they were no longer concerned about defending their basic human rights. They pushed for even more advancement in society because they had the flexibility to construct their country whatever they chose.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was also a rise in aggressive nationalism.

        <h2>Compare and Contrast Between French Revolution and American Revolution (Causes and Outcomes)</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                 Enlightenment and democratic ideals and conceptions swept throughout Europe and, later, the colonies during this period. These views fueled colonists' frustration of their lack of representation and participation in government, leading them to consider the radical idea of a monarch-less republic, which was unthinkable at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these enlightenment principles, a large number of colonists thought it undesirable and unfair to be taxed and ruled by kings who did not have their best interests at heart, with little to no representation. Even though the Americans put a high value on trade and frequently avoided paying taxes (via smuggling, boycotting, and other means), it was often the lack of representation that sparked revolutionary fervor. It was simply unjust to them. Many people believe that having representation and being "bullied" is more essential than merely paying taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                They both face similar economic causes, modified, but ultimately instigated by the unreasonable tax rates as well as the inconsideration by the colonial powers that owned them. France, especially the king, disregarded its peoples. The American Revoultion sought independence because of the disconnect in loyalists values between Great Britain and The Thirteen Colonies. All in all, it's clear that with the ideas of enlightenment, these revolutions destroys the previous status quo, and create new republics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing to note is that both revolutions are the prime examples for revolutions, as the American Revolution was the best example to which enabled the French Revolution. Later, we see this being applicable to everywhere else. The French revolution was strongly affected by the American revolution, which served as a type of springboard for their proposed system. The French National Assembly, for example, based their declaration of rights on the American Declaration of Independence.

    Furthermore, France's active engagement in both the Seven Years' War and the Revolutionary War put enormous financial burden on the country, leading to a revolution and, perhaps more importantly, the creation of the conditions for a dictator, Napoleon. Napoleon's conquests across Europe are seen to have been one of the driving forces for German and Italian nationalism and unification, which spread a fervor of nationalism and liberalism throughout Europe and, as a result, the world.

    Our current world, which is made up entirely of nation-states, can be traced back to these events; our world would be unrecognizable without a globe of nation-states.

            </p>

            <p>
                Other than altering the social and political structure of countries, we can see the expansion of both powers; particularly Napleon's wars and the American expansion past the Appalachians. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The establishment of a republican government in the world, which profoundly influenced the path of history all around the globe. The first large-scale example of a country deposing its monarchy and establishing a viable republic that avoids dictatorship. This however, is different from the french revolution, as Napaleon became the dictator of France after the French Revolution.
